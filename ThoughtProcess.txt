HOW TO VISUALIZE DATA

After iterating, each cell will have a value of -1 (Included in the set, or at least hasn't escaped yet) or a positive
integer representing the iteratons it took to first escape the local area (Circle of radius 2 centered on the origin)

A square grid of n*n cells is used to represent the data.
This grid should be interactive and support translation and zoom operations.
Zooming should have a target that is the cursor position

Current model:

The grid is represented by its top left point and edge length.
Edge length is different from the resolution, which is number of cells to an edge.

The view square is initialized using:
Its top left corner (Default is 2,2)
Edge length (Default is 4, to capture the entire local area)
Resolution (A measure of pixels used to make an edge, default is 500 giving a 500x500 pixel display)

Each pixel must be mapped to its corresponding coordinate in fractal space, for example setting the resolution to 2
would give 4 pixels, each covering a quadrant on the cartesian(?) plane.

Translations should only affect the top left coordinate.
Translations can be decoupled from the current zoom level by taking the difference start and end positions of the mouse
as translations relative to the current edge length.

Zooming is more complicated.
